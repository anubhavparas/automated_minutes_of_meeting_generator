      "okay good morning everybody is welcome\n",
      " today we are very happy to have on the phone with us Wayne Olson from Reynolds & Consulting and the presenter of our program and a couple of months ago as you may or may not know when comes with a broad that's and brakes or fundraising experience and when he introduces himself you will give you a quick bio today's session is really intended to specifically address the question that we constantly get is how to include paint given in our regular fundraising conversation so in other words how do we have a blended conversation we started talking about that at the most recent session we're not going to be getting into the details of what kind of plant gifts are the best friend gifts to talk about this is not a technical session it's really one we want to have a conversation the conversation of What kinds of things are appropriate opportunities to open up the dialogue with the donor what opportunities do you have to introduce the creditors Legacy and Jewish Marathon\n",
      " Nations partnership and hopefully by the end of today station you feel you have a few nuggets and the few opportunities for ideas on ways to engage Ordonez we're talking in this case specifically we're not specifically for the most part we're talking about doing is they're already engaged in your organization who you want to elevate to the conversation obtain giving the Centereach introduced ourselves we won't do that again but I'll just summarize with who's on the phone and what organizations you're representing so we know who we talking to Wayne will do provide some comments for 15 or 20 minutes I will then provide some comments from the Jewish Community Foundation perspective will definitely have good time for questions so please write them down as things progressed through our session and then at the very end time too many would have some opportunities for roleplay so we're going to put rain on the spot and meet perhaps if you so choose but try to try to hit on Wayne and then if you have some role-playing conversations\n",
      " if you were the dealer\n",
      " and you hear a particular car mental or objective objectionable or a question how would you like to get some ideas on how to approach those objections and we'll we'll certainly make that opportunity available to you if you want to role play to each other that'd be fun too so currently we have genital from Hello Janet is a volunteer for hello she's also text me Foundation board member and chair of our investment committee thanks Jennifer joining us wherever Bank Green who is the development director I think Friendship Circle\n",
      " so campus gives you all know stupid of the community Jewish family service director of major gifts have records from Israel synagogue the administrative director as you will know who works very closely with my box and rosenthal's has really been involved in our in our program for a long time we're dinner Batman who's the Senate veterans manager and saw the circle Legacy representative from the Federation\n",
      " make Modell's with us as a volunteer and past president for Beth Israel along with many other hats that she wears\n",
      " and we have need one of his representing the San Diego Jewish Academy as the Development Associate and works for Shell jacket lives are so welcome everybody if I have not mentioned your name please let us know that you're on the phone\n",
      " well then you're not when I hand it over to you\n",
      " you asked me to give you a little bit bye oh I've been in front or anything for about sixteen years I'm a trial attorney by trade I do a lot of writing on sun raising for Crescendo interactive and for a few other sources and I also have a radio show that's airing weekly in Alabama seem to be originally maybe nationally on fundraising and philanthropy and written two books on raising with a third coming out later this year but all that to say that I'm very fortunate to do what I love and that's fundraising wondering aloud even more is helping other people countries better so hopefully we can do that today\n",
      " you want me to get started shortly and please don't have one okay you know I want to start by telling you very quick story and everything I'm going to do today is going to be fairly fast and and quit but it also fairly easy but very first day on the job I walk in and they told me hear the checks were going to send to the donors\n",
      " and I have no idea what thing that I thought it was pretty sophisticated and knew what I was doing at the fancy trial attorney and here they are handing the test of the donors that happened to be for gift annuity we're not going to go into detail today but what I want you to feel comfortable is that you're never going to have all the answers that there's always going to be some part plan getting that you're not going to know so no matter how long you've been in this business and even today there's things that I learn you never going to know everything but what started the beginning\n",
      " the first thing you need to know is suffering many people I talk to who are curious about incorporating play and getting into their program is not really sure how it works or what they need to answer what they need to do and and in the point you need to remember is that you're never asking for money even with plan giving especially with plan getting you're not asking for money you're you're really just asking for this person's information that they believe in you and they believe in the mission you also have to remember as you can you set the frame if the person you're talking to is on your side\n",
      " anything is as you talk about playing getting you'll realize there's just as many benefits for the donor as the rest for the organization what's going to help you is any set time frame remember your area of expertise it helped my confidence when I remember that when I'm talking with a donor they don't expect me to be their attorney they don't expect me to be their account\n",
      " you need to be an expert on the organization I represent so it could be an effective plan getting officer for all the people who are with us today the first and only thing you need to be is an expert on your organization be an expert on the Friendship Circle be an expert on Jewish Family Service or be an expert on Congregation Beth Israel that is what they want and expect with you if you happen to know something about some of the plan get the vehicle that's fine that's good but through we expecting you to be an expert on your mission and pointing and directions of plane getting\n",
      " hey do you want you to suggest ideas maybe but not not right there well for them but not right the trust I just want to have ideas and the one thing I wanted you to put in your pocket and always keep in your pocket is always okay it's always acceptable to say you know I don't know the answer to that question may I get back to you that's always a preferable answer or response and getting getting a wrong response\n",
      " I want you to know you have a friend on the phone with you and that's Charlene always feel free to call Charlene a notice on volunteering Charlene call Charlene with any questions you have that's what she's there for can I help you with questions you have about plan getting\n",
      " remember to if you're in a conversation with a donor you have permission to talk about planned giving you have permission to to talk about how plain getting might benefit the donor or might help and owner and help the Cherry\n",
      " and and that's all I have for the framework for remembering going into the meeting let me tell you now how you might approach the meeting and make a meeting easier or an encounter with a donor a little bit easier\n",
      " the first thing to remember is planet think about what you're going to say thank you. The purpose of the meeting and never feel pressured to say too much or go too fast it's got to be natural the example I use and I think this is a perfect example for plan getting is when I was going on my very first date with my wife she was Tom my wife and she was a somebody had met at a different event and this was our first time alone together on a date and somewhere in the back of our minds with some level we were both thinking this is somebody that I want to marry or it might be somebody that I want to marry or this is a tryout for possible marriage no point during that first meeting did we ever say to each other hey you know what the hell tonight goes if it goes well we'll do this again if it goes well we'll do it again and we'll get married at 50th it goes okay we'll all get married and then at five years we'll have two kids and then we'll move to Alabama\n",
      " no no we could it one step at a time and your relationship with a donor has to be the same way it has to be a natural progression and and the nice thing is the donor is always going to want to talk to you about Mission but plan giving the other things those are just things that come along for the ride and and you have to remember it's always the definition\n",
      " here's some phrases that I can come up with it might help you transition a conversation you're having into plan giving\n",
      " for example this is Colin you've been so generous to us with all of your gifts you've given us ten dollars every year for the last ten years are you you're always the one we can tell on to to donate something when we need it during celebrations things like that ever thought about continuing that generosity for years to come have you ever thought about a way you can make that a permanent Legacy of your life and will always remember you and always will always be part of the celebration even for decades and centuries to come or mrs. Cohen it's been such a privilege to work even all your generous giving you no wonder if there's anything else we can explore together it might be even better for you but it might be more beneficial for you than the way you have been giving perhaps we could talk about some things that would help you even more\n",
      " all right here's some phrases for you to use and these are going to be in the handout you receive\n",
      " have you ever thought about what your impact is going to be what your legacy is going to be\n",
      " have you ever talked with your attorney about charitable long-term planning\n",
      " have you thought about including our mission in your wheel when you located\n",
      " you know there's ways of getting where you can also get tax benefits and other things like payments back to you mrs. Cohen I'm not an expert but I really appreciate your giving would it be possible for you to work with your attorney or maybe was trying to lean I don't ways you can make it even bigger impact with less money out of your pocket\n",
      " and you know a lot of our donors have including wheels in our mission in their wills and before about that and and I'm going to give you a secret weapon to and this is something I've used many times and you can use this as many times as you wish and you'll never you'll never go wrong using it this is mrs. Cohen\n",
      " we are trying to encourage more donors to include us in their Wills how do you recommend we do that\n",
      " can you create it as a friend and a colleague and your Acura and it's all true there's nothing dishonest about that and she's going to give you the answer of how you ask her and at the end of the conversation you saying this is Colin that's very good I like your advice I'm going to use it but have you ever thought about you including a senior well and that's easy natural transition\n",
      " any of these phrases I'm going to give you some more praises to talk about an invitation to do more and this is the key as you start to feel more comfortable plan getting you'll start to hear phrases that or the donor's way of opening the door in the same way going back to the dating situation where my future wife would say things like you know I could never live in California well that would cross her off the list right away cuz I know that that's not going to happen to some day I'm going to live in San Diego I know so you know but you can get along the way that broadcast where you're heading hear some things that donors will say that our door opening to talk about plane getting this is just a sample but you'll get a flavor for how it goes\n",
      " I wish I could do more I just don't have the money I'm so disappointed with my investments then just to start or what they need to be CD rates are terrible have you seen how bad the CD rates are my house is too big or I don't need such a big house anymore you know when you walk in and the donor starts cleaning up and saying oh I'm sorry the house is a mess the house is so big I wish I didn't have to keep this big help clean anymore that's a problem for you to think about things that you could do with her it would solve a problem for her she could give the house to you or do it life as they are all these other tools that we won't talk about today just know they're out there there are things that she can do to make life better for you and better for her and support the mission of your organization\n",
      " you never go on by using questions that begin with who what where when and why\n",
      " this is current why do you give to us this is Colin what's the most important thing you see for us in the next five or ten years\n",
      " this is Cohen when do you think we'll be able to build that new Family Life Center we've been talking about\n",
      " this is Colin what is the most important thing we do for you those are all Clues\n",
      " or questions you can use where you can find out what the donors priorities are and how you can match the donors priorities to what you're able to offer\n",
      " but mainly just listen you know when you're with the donor donor sophisticated today they have the internet they have the and the research and they they get a brochure a week and they mail you don't have to worry about them knowing what time getting is cuz they're they're being inundated by other Cherry the only thing you have to know is the only thing you have to do is what they're doing the know that you also are willing to accept a clan gift and that you're open to the idea of a planned gift in addition to an annual fund gift or a major gift\n",
      " crazy breathe I tried to be simple I tried to make it a done this with the understanding that some of you may have no experience with plan on giving but we should have more and they're just getting started I'm going to turn it over to Charles email but I hope what there's any questions you may have or any any particular issues you may have that we can solve this for you today great thank you waiting I'll give you each a moment to just catch your breath and we'll move on to the next section\n",
      " remember too that if they're questions that you would like for Wayne or or any of us when we're done I will address those shortly I want to transfer a little bit to JC and how it relates to your conversations though I appreciate the referral to always call me when I do want to just stress that we were a team here at the foundation that has more than one person being available to do this kind of work certainly there are some of us who are more ingrained in that every day and we absolutely have germy Pro as you will know I'll see if I lose our technical specialist and I'd rather just give it his credentials but as soon as I start talking about anything that's honey-honey technical even I transfer those conversations to Jeremy so just know that how it whatever the level of conversation occurs or comes up sooner you can call me and I'll be the right we sold to direct you to the assistance that is most appropriate but there will be times that you'll talk to one other arrest and also know that as we're working with them as we\n",
      " this is very same conversation we don't be done it all the time and how do we integrate although in the conversations with a plan gift the concept of a pan gets weather is for Joseph which is on the less often fail to working on behalf of as an honest broker all of our local Jewish organizations which we do all the time in our Legacy planning at our mission to increase plan given to the whole community so remember that word whizzle with them as we're undergoing the same kinds of considerations how do I bring it up for the person's had a donor-advised fund for a long time when's the right time is this the right person who's the decision maker and my having a conversation as a bad time that life all those considerations we work with every day so when we provide some food for thought know that we don't think of ourselves as experts that we think that maybe practice that a little bit more than others\n",
      " so this is now one of the address is we must remember that because we talking about current owners the most important thing to do before you start any other conversation is to recognize their current giving recognize current giving first we cannot say thank you enough time so thank you thank you thank you always comes before any other conversation because the purpose of the pen gift is to really recognize and honor the current contribution way into the future that's the purpose of the plan gift the 10 gift isn't really a stand-alone items rarely doesn't come from a person who hasn't been a supporter over the years now we know AJ face is probably a good example where these unexpected the quest coming from people that perhaps won't even on the radar of the organization\n",
      " for most of us that's more than likely they'll always a great trip and that happens so I think the first hard to remember that when you go into these conversations the purpose is to honor their current giving we also know in the data have shown that people to make a plan gifts and commit to a planned gift are more likely to increase their annual giving That's What statistic that's very interesting but hasn't been shown enough because often times different people fundraisers feel that if I stop American gift it means I'm deferring the a new gift classic country anybody who cares enough to invest in the future is most definitely going to invest in the in the presence\n",
      " so introduced and given concept of you talk about and recognize all current events and ways to do that and again these will be in the notes that we provide you would be something like may I speak with you about how we can honor your current giving off your last time so I said thank you I wanted to give the folks about what we've been doing mission-based and Wayne was talking about I'm sure everything what's going on in the preschool and what event happened at the synagogue or what program is being Innovative address or the new building and then I say may I speak with you about how we can on your current given up your lifetime\n",

Academy as the Development Associate and works for Shell jacket lives are so welcome everybody if I have not mentioned your name please let us know that you're on the phone. well then you're not when I hand it over to you. you asked me to give you a little bit bye oh I've been in front or anything for about sixteen years I'm a trial attorney by trade I do a lot of writing on sun raising for

we're not going to go into detail today but what I want you to feel comfortable is that you're never going to have all the answers that there's always going to be some part plan getting that you're

talk about playing getting you'll realize there's just as many benefits for the donor as the rest for the organization what's going to help you is any set time frame remember your area of expertise it helped my confidence when I remember that when I'm talking with a donor they don't expect me to be their attorney they don't expect me to be their account. you need to be an expert on the organization I represent so it could be an effective plan getting officer for all the people who are with us today the first and only thing you need to be is an expert on your organization be an expert on the Friendship Circle be an expert on Jewish Family Service or be an expert on Congregation Beth Israel that is what they want and expect with you if you happen to know something about some of the plan get the vehicle that's fine that's good but through we expecting you to be an expert on your mission and pointing and directions of plane getting. hey do you want you to suggest ideas maybe but not

acceptable to say you know I don't know the answer to that question may I get back to you that's always a preferable answer or response and getting getting a wrong response. I want you to know you have a friend on the phone with you and that's Charlene always feel free to call Charlene a notice on volunteering Charlene call Charlene with any questions you have that's what she's there for can I help you with questions you have about plan getting. remember to if you're in a conversation with a donor you have permission to talk about planned giving you have permission to to talk about how plain getting might benefit the donor or might help and owner and help the Cherry. and and that's all I have for the framework for remembering going into the meeting let me tell you now how you might approach the meeting and make a meeting easier or an encounter with a donor a little bit easier. the first thing to remember is planet think about what you're going to say thank you. The purpose of the meeting and never feel pressured to say too much or go too fast it's got to be natural the example I use and I think this is a perfect example for plan getting is when I was going on my very first date with my wife she was Tom my wife and she was a somebody had met at a different event and this was our first time alone together on a date and somewhere in the back of our minds with some level we were both thinking this is somebody that I want to marry or it might be somebody that I want to marry or this is a tryout for possible marriage no point during that first meeting did we ever say to each other hey you know what the hell tonight goes if it goes well we'll do this again if it goes well we'll do it again and we'll get married at 50th it goes okay we'll all get married and then at five years we'll have two kids and then we'll move to Alabama. no no we could it one step at a time and your relationship with a donor has to be the same way it has to be a natural progression and and the nice thing is the donor is always going to want to talk to you about Mission but plan giving the other things those are just things that come along for the ride and and you have to remember it's always the definition. here's some phrases that I can come up with it might help you transition a conversation you're having into plan giving. for example this is Colin you've been so generous to us with all of your gifts you've given us ten dollars every year for the last ten years are you you're always the one we can tell on to to donate something when we need it during celebrations things like that ever thought about continuing that generosity for years to come have you ever thought about a way you can make that a permanent Legacy of your life and will always remember you and always will always be part of the celebration even for decades and centuries to come or mrs. Cohen it's been such a privilege to work even all your generous giving you no wonder if there's anything else we can explore together it might be even better for you but it might be more beneficial for you than the way you have been giving perhaps we could talk about some things that would help you even more. all right here's some phrases for you to use and these are going to be in the handout you receive. have you ever thought about what your impact is going to be what your legacy is going to be. have you ever talked with your attorney about charitable long-term planning. have you thought about including our mission in your wheel when you located. you know there's ways of getting where you can also get tax benefits and other things like payments back to you mrs. Cohen I'm not an expert but I really appreciate your giving would it be possible for you to work with your attorney or maybe was trying to lean I don't ways you can make it even bigger impact with less money out of your pocket. and you know a lot of our donors have including wheels in our mission in their wills and before about that and and I'm going to give you a secret weapon to and this is something I've used many times and you can use this as many times as you wish and you'll never you'll never go wrong using it this is mrs. Cohen. we are trying to encourage more donors to include us in their Wills how do you recommend we do that. can you create it as a friend and a colleague and your Acura and it's all true there's nothing dishonest about that and she's going to give you the answer of how you ask her and at the end of the conversation you saying this is Colin that's very good I like your advice I'm going to use it but have you ever thought about you including a senior well and that's easy natural transition. any of these phrases I'm going to give you some more praises to talk about an invitation to do more and this is the key as you start to feel more comfortable plan getting you'll start to hear phrases that or the donor's way of opening the door in the same way going back to the dating situation where my future wife would say things like you know I could never live in California well that would cross her off the list right away cuz I know that that's not going to happen to some day I'm going to live in San Diego I know so you know but you can get along the way that broadcast where you're heading hear some things that donors will say that our door opening to talk about plane getting this is just a sample but you'll get a flavor for how it goes. I wish I could do more I just don't have the money I'm so disappointed with my investments then just to start or what they need to be CD rates are terrible have you seen how bad the CD rates are my house is too big or I don't need such a big house anymore you know when you walk in and the donor starts cleaning up and saying oh I'm sorry the house is a mess the house is so big I wish I didn't have to keep this big help clean anymore that's a problem for you to think about things that you could do with her it would solve a problem for her she could give the house to you or do it life as they are all these other tools that we won't talk about today just know they're out there there are things that she can do to make life better for you and better for her and support the mission of your organization. you never go on by using questions that begin with who what where when and why. this is current why do you give to us this is Colin what's the most important thing you see for us in the next five or ten years. this is Cohen when do you think we'll be able to build that new Family Life Center we've been talking about. this is Colin what is the most important thing we do for you those are all Clues. or questions you can use where you can find out what the donors priorities are and how you can match the donors priorities to what you're able to offer. but mainly just listen you know when you're with the donor donor sophisticated today they have the internet they have the and the research and they they get a brochure a week and they mail you don't have to worry about them knowing what time getting is cuz they're they're being inundated by other Cherry the only thing you have to know is the only thing you have to do is what they're doing the know that you also are willing to accept a clan gift and that you're open to the idea of a planned gift in addition to an annual fund gift or a major gift. crazy breathe I tried to be simple I tried to make it a done this with the understanding that some of you may have no experience with plan on giving but we should have more and they're just getting started I'm going to turn it over to Charles email but I hope what there's any questions you may have or any any particular issues you may have that we can solve this for you today great thank you waiting I'll give you each a moment to just catch your breath and we'll move on to the next section. remember too that if they're questions that you would like for Wayne or or any of us when we're done I will address those shortly I want to transfer a little bit to JC and how it relates to your conversations though I appreciate the referral to always call me when I do want to just stress that we were a team here at the foundation that has more than one person being available to do this kind of work certainly there are some of us who are more ingrained in that every day and we absolutely have germy Pro as you will know I'll see if I lose our technical specialist and I'd rather just give it his credentials but as soon as I start talking about anything that's honey-honey technical even I transfer those conversations to Jeremy so just know that how it whatever the level of conversation occurs or comes up sooner you can call me and I'll be the right we sold to direct you to the assistance that is most appropriate but there will be times that you'll talk to one other arrest and also know that as we're working with them as we. this is very same conversation we don't be done it all the time and how do we integrate although in the conversations with a plan gift the concept of a pan gets weather is for Joseph which is on the less often fail to working on behalf of as an honest broker all of our local Jewish organizations which we do all the time in our Legacy planning at our mission to increase plan given to the whole community so remember that word whizzle with them as we're undergoing the same kinds of considerations how do I bring it up for the person's had a donor-advised fund for a long time when's the right time is this the right person who's the decision maker and my having a conversation as a bad time that life all those considerations we work with every day so when we provide some food for thought know that we don't think of ourselves as experts that we think that maybe practice that a little bit more than others. so this is now one of the address is we must remember that because we talking about current owners the most important thing to do before you start any other conversation is to recognize their current giving recognize current giving first we cannot say thank you enough time so thank you thank you thank you always comes before any other conversation because the purpose of the pen gift is to really recognize and honor the current contribution way into the future that's the purpose of the plan gift the 10 gift isn't really a stand-alone items rarely doesn't come from a person who hasn't been a supporter over the years now we know AJ face is probably a good example where these unexpected the quest coming from people that perhaps won't even on the radar of the organization. for most of us that's more than likely they'll always a great trip and that happens so I think the first hard to remember that when you go into these conversations the purpose is to honor their current giving we also know in the data have shown that people to make a plan gifts and commit to a planned gift are more likely to increase their annual giving That's What statistic that's very interesting but hasn't been shown enough because often times different people fundraisers feel that if I stop American gift it means I'm deferring the a new gift classic country anybody who cares enough to invest in the future is most definitely going to invest in the in the presence. so introduced and given concept of you talk about and recognize all current events and ways to do that and again these will be in the notes that we provide you would be something like may I speak with you about how we can honor your current giving off your last time so I said thank you I wanted to give the folks about what we've been doing mission-based and Wayne was talking about I'm sure everything what's going on in the preschool and what event happened at the synagogue or what program is being Innovative address or the new building and then I say may I speak with you about how we can on your current given up your lifetime. what my two of my favorite things to include and every conversation is silence there two times you can do that the first one is by pausing between questions and situations that you present so may I speak with you about how we can honor your current giving off your lifetime before we launch into the next entrance of explanation of what that means just let them hear that just let them ponder that let them think about that. and that's the first time for you to be silent. the second time for you to be silent is when they all speak.\n"
